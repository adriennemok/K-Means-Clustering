# K-Means Clustering
A computationally fast and efficient k-means algorithm based on BLAS-3 routines

<p><strong>kmeans.py</strong>: Computes pairwise Euclidean distances between two sets of data points, implementing both a slow algorithm and a much faster algorithm based on BLAS-3 routines.</p>
<p><strong>driver1.py</strong>: Tests kmeans.py script on a small dataset (Iris dataset)</p>
<p><strong>driver2.py</strong>: Tests kmeans.py on a large data set of ~200,000 image patches for dictionary learning in the context of image recognition</p>
